      Open a new browser tab (I'd recommend incognito mode), open dev tools at
      'Network' tab then follow the link:
      <a href="https://app.strive.school/" target="_blank"
        >https://app.strive.school/</a
      >
      then login with Discord, and once student dashboard is loaded, you should
      see an access token as shown on the screenshot. Copy it and paste into
      corresponding field.

      Upon completing the test, click 'open leaderboard' and there you can find
      examID in the URL, as shown on the screenshot: Copy it and paste into
      corresponding field.

    <br />
    <p>With these two values you can access the app.</p>

      I DO NOT STORE NONE OF THESE ANYWHERE! IT USED EXCLUSEVILY FOR FETCHING
      DATA. If you're really curious about it: feel free to view the source
      code. The link is in the footer.
